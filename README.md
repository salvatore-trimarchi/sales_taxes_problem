# Sales Taxes Problem

This is a single page application, based on PHP, Laravel-Mix, Vue.js and Axios.

Once downloaded in a local folder, it is available within a local server environment (such as MAMP, WAMP, XAMPP).

Supplied test data and topic-related configurations are placed in several back-end PHP files and delivered to the front-end via API-like calls based on Axios, to emulate database stored information. 

Laravel-Mix is used to compile CSS and JavaScript. 

Front-end view and Axios calls are managed by Vue.js. 

## Run the application

To run this application directly in a folder you need:
- A local server environment, such as MAMP, WAMP, XAMPP (which webserver document root contains the project folder)
- The [GitHub repository URL](https://github.com/salvatore-trimarchi/sales_taxes_problem.git) for 'git clone' in a local folder
- A Laravel-Mix installation (run 'npm install' and 'npx mix', within the project folder)
